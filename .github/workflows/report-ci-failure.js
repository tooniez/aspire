// Red-main CI reporter, used by ci.yml. Files/updates a single deduplicated issue
// when a push to a protected branch (main, release/**) fails CI, and closes that
// issue again when a later push to the same branch is green.
//
// Self-closing by design: ci.yml runs on every push, so a green push is the most
// timely signal that the branch is no longer red — there is no need to wait for an
// external 2h poll. The issue still carries an autoClose:true stamp (see
// tracking-issue.js) so the scheduled watchdog can also close it as a backstop.
//
// Per-branch keying: a red `main` and a red `release/13.3` are different problems,
// so the marker embeds the ref and each branch gets its own issue. Example markers:
//   <!-- ci-failure:ci.yml:push:main -->
//   <!-- ci-failure:ci.yml:push:release/13.3 -->
//
// The reusable find-or-create + comment-dedup loop and the octokit primitives live
// in ./tracking-issue.js. The pure helpers here are unit-tested by
// tests/Infrastructure.Tests/WorkflowScripts/ReportCiFailureTests.cs; reportFailure()
// and resolveSuccess() are covered through report-ci-failure.integration.harness.js.
