"""Compute user-facing signals for the pr-docs-check workflow.

This script is invoked by `.github/workflows/pr-docs-check.md` as a
pre-agent step. It writes a JSON document containing a fixed catalog of
boolean "user-facing change" signals derived from objective evidence:

  - Changed-file paths (Group A)
  - Diff hunk contents — added and/or removed lines (Group B)
  - PR body regexes (Group C)
  - PR labels (Group D)
  - An advisory "only_test_or_build_changes" flag (never gates)

The agent reads the resulting file verbatim and treats
`recommendation == "docs_required"` as a hard "draft a docs PR" gate.
Each triggered signal carries evidence (file path + matching diff
fragment or PR-body snippet) so the audit trail is reproducible.

Backport PRs are hard-excluded: when `excluded == true` (with
`exclusion_reasons` recording why), the PR is out of scope for docs
generation regardless of which signals fired, because a backport is
documented against its original forward PR — see `detect_backport`.

Usage
-----

    python3 compute_signals.py <pr.json> <files.json> <out.json>

where `pr.json` is the body of `GET /repos/microsoft/aspire/pulls/{N}`
and `files.json` is the concatenated body of
`GET /repos/microsoft/aspire/pulls/{N}/files?per_page=100` (paginated
and JSON-arrayed).

The catalog is intentionally broad. The worst case for a false positive
is a drafted docs PR that a human closes (drafted PRs never auto-merge),
while a false negative ships an undocumented user-facing change. Favor
recall over precision.

Running the tests
-----------------

    python3 -m unittest discover -s .github/workflows/pr-docs-check -v

# Exclusion: backport PRs
# ============================================================
# A backport PR ports an already-merged change onto a release branch. Its
# user-facing documentation is authored against the original (forward) PR on
# the default branch, so a backport must NEVER spawn its own aspire.dev docs
# PR — even when it carries user-facing signals. Re-documenting a backport is
# pure noise: a duplicate draft PR a human has to close.
#
# This matters because the workflow runs on release/* merges as well as main
# (see `on:` in pr-docs-check.md), so without this guard every merged backport
# would be analyzed and could draft a redundant docs PR.
#
# We detect both the `/backport` bot's PRs (.github/workflows/backport.yml)
# and explicit/manual backports, which follow the same conventions. The matched
# reason names are surfaced in `exclusion_reasons` for the audit trail:
#
#   reason name              strength  example match

#
# A STRONG marker is positive evidence that the PR is a port of an
# already-merged change, so any one of them is sufficient to exclude. The
# `/backport` bot always sets all three of head/title/body (see backport.yml:
# temp branch `backport/pr-<n>-to-<target>`, title `[%target%] %title%`, body
# `Backport of #%n% to %target%`), so a real backport is always caught.
#
# `base_branch_is_release` is WEAK and is NOT sufficient on its own: the
# workflow triggers on `release/*` merges (see `on:`), so a release base also
# matches a direct release-only fix authored straight against `release/*` — and
# that IS exactly the kind of user-facing change this workflow exists to catch.
# Excluding on the base ref alone would silently skip docs for it. We therefore
# only exclude when at least one strong marker is present; the release base is
# still recorded alongside the strong markers when one fires, but never drives
