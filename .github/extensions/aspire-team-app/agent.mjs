// Prompt builders for the card action buttons on the Aspire Team App canvas.
//
// A split button in the iframe POSTs { kind, target, pr } to the loopback server,
// which calls the injected agent bridge (copilotSession.send) with one of the prompts
// below. The prompt lands as a user turn in the *main* Copilot session, so the agent —
// not this extension — is what actually calls open_pr_session or does the interactive
// work. (The extension can only queue into its own session; opening a session in another
// repo is an app-level agent tool, so cross-repo actions must route through the agent.)
//
// Each action has two targets, chosen from the button's dropdown:
//   - "new-session" (default): open a NEW sub-session in the context of the PR's repo
//     via open_pr_session, so the work runs against the right repository even when the
//     canvas is hosted from an unrelated repo. Test, Review, and Review-debt self-detect a
//     matching skill (/pr-testing or /code-review) and fall back to a thorough manual pass;
//     Fix-CI self-detects a CI-failure diagnosis skill (/ci-test-failures) and otherwise
//     evaluates the failing checks manually; Discuss-review talks through the outstanding
//     feedback and lays out response options; Address-feedback works the unresolved review
//     threads and resolves them; the conflict action runs a direct git flow.
//   - "current-session": do the work right here, in the session that owns the canvas,
//     without spawning a sub-session. Useful when the canvas is already open on the PR's
//     own repo and the user wants to stay in this conversation.
//
