// TODO: use WaitFor() for strict build and startup ordering between apiservice, workerservice, and worker.
// Until the coordinated .slnx build lands, the DotnetProjectResource launches each service via its own `dotnet run`, 
// so two services building the shared Playground.ServiceDefaults/SharedLibrary at the same time
// would race on the build outputs (e.g. *.deps.json). Chaining the waits guarantees only one service builds at a time.
// Remove the WaitFor() calls once the coordinated build is in place.
