// A deliberately old-fashioned interactive console game, run as a .NET file-based app
// (`dotnet run --file numberguess.cs -- <limit>`).
//
// It exists to demonstrate driving an interactive process from AppHost code: the AppHost shows this program in an
// PromptTerminalAsync interaction, then plays it by typing guesses and reading the replies back off the terminal
// screen. Nothing here knows it is being automated - it is an ordinary Console.ReadLine app.
//
// The reply format is the contract the automation relies on, so it is deliberately unambiguous:
//
//     Guess #1: 50            <- the prompt, plus the tty's echo of what was typed
//       >> #1: 50 is too high <- the reply, tagged with the attempt number
//
// Tagging each reply with its attempt number means the automation can wait for ">> #3:" and be certain it is
// reading the response to its third guess rather than a stale line still on screen from an earlier one.
