## Examples

To initialize an empty C# AppHost without discovering incidental `.sln` or `.slnx` files, run this from the repository root:

```bash
aspire init --file-based --language csharp
```

This creates `apphost.cs` and its supporting configuration in the current directory instead of creating a solution-based AppHost project. `--file-based` requires C#: it reports an error before scaffolding if another language is selected explicitly, configured, or chosen at the language prompt. Omit `--file-based` (or pass `--file-based false`) to use normal non-C# scaffolding. It does not overwrite existing AppHosts or suppress agent setup.

```bash
# Create a new Aspire application
aspire new

# Run the apphost
aspire run

# Start in the background (useful for CI and agent environments)
aspire start --isolated

# Check resource status
aspire describe

# Stream resource state changes
aspire describe --follow

# View logs
aspire logs
aspire logs webapi

# Stop the apphost
aspire stop

# Wait for a resource to be healthy (CI/scripts)
aspire start
aspire wait webapi --timeout 60

# Add an integration
aspire add redis

# Diagnose environment issues
aspire doctor

# Search the API reference
aspire docs api search "RunAsEmulator" --language csharp

# Search Aspire documentation
aspire docs search "redis"
```

## Shell completion

`aspire completions script [bash|fish|pwsh|zsh]` writes a shell script to stdout.
When omitted, the shell is inferred from `SHELL`, falling back to `pwsh` on Windows.
Specify the shell explicitly in installers and profiles: a login shell need not be
the shell currently running. `cmd.exe` and Windows PowerShell are not supported.

The hooks query the CLI's live command model for commands, subcommands, options,
and values with completion sources (including enum values). They do not need
`dotnet-suggest`. Tab requests do not execute commands, launch AppHosts, prefetch
packages, collect telemetry, or write CLI logs or first-use state. Suggestions do
not query running resources or search package feeds.

Bash and Zsh complete the current command after separators and preserve literal
arguments inside single or double quotes. Bash also decodes ANSI-C quotes such as
`$'a\tb'`, including their escape sequences. Input is decoded without evaluating
shell substitutions; accepting a suggestion must not execute its contents.
Settings used for completion are normalized in memory without rewriting the
configuration files.

The examples below assume `aspire` is on PATH. They resolve the active command
on every request, so upgrades and switching install routes do not pin completion
to an old binary. Do not replace it with a versioned npm cache, tool store, or
Homebrew staging path.

### Bash

Enable in the current shell:

```bash
source <(aspire completions script bash)
```

For future interactive shells, add this once to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
if command -v aspire >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    source <(aspire completions script bash)
fi
```

If you use login shells, ensure the login profile sources `~/.bashrc`.
Remove the block to disable persistent completion; `complete -r aspire` removes
the registration from the current shell.

### Zsh

If you manage Zsh initialization yourself, source the script after `compinit`.
Otherwise, the generated script initializes the completion system, excluding
insecure completion directories rather than prompting during profile loading:

```zsh
source <(aspire completions script zsh)
```

For persistence, add the following once to `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc`, after
the existing `compinit` call:

```zsh
if (( $+commands[aspire] )); then
    source <(aspire completions script zsh)
fi
```

Alternatively, save the generated script as `_aspire` in a directory on `fpath`
before calling `compinit`. Remove your source block or `_aspire` file to undo
setup; `compdef -d aspire` removes the current session's registration.

### Fish

Enable in the current shell:

```fish
aspire completions script fish | source
```

For persistence, save the generated file in Fish's user completion directory:

```fish
set -l completion_dir ~/.config/fish/completions
if set -q XDG_CONFIG_HOME
    set completion_dir "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/completions"
end
mkdir -p "$completion_dir"
aspire completions script fish > "$completion_dir/aspire.fish"
```

Remove that file to undo persistent setup; `complete --erase --command aspire`
and `functions --erase __aspire_complete` remove the current session's registration
and helper.

### PowerShell 7+

Enable in the current session:

```powershell
aspire completions script pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

For persistence, add this once to your chosen PowerShell profile:

```powershell
if (Get-Command aspire -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
    aspire completions script pwsh | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
}
```

`$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts` applies to all PowerShell hosts for the current
user and edition; `$PROFILE` applies only to the current host. Obtain the path
inside **pwsh**, not Windows PowerShell. Create the profile's parent directory
and file if needed, without replacing existing contents. Do not modify a signed
profile or change execution policy to enable completions. Remove the block and
start a new session to undo registration. `-NoProfile` deliberately skips profiles.

### Installation routes

| Route | Completion setup |
|-------|------------------|
| Custom release scripts | Generate a completion file and register it in the supported user's shell. `--skip-completions` / `-SkipCompletions` opts out. Dry-run/WhatIf does not write registration. |
| PR/dogfood scripts | Keep transient installs out of persistent profiles; use the printed activation instructions for the session. |
| WinGet | Portable ZIP installation has no post-install hook. Installation notes point to manual setup above. |
| npm global install | Use the manual setup above. npm lifecycle hooks do not reliably identify the user's shell, can be disabled, and have no uninstall hook. No profile edits occur during npm install. |
| .NET global or `--tool-path` install | Use the manual setup above after putting the tool shim on PATH. `dotnet tool install` has no supported publisher post-install hook. |
| Homebrew cask | Homebrew owns generated Bash/Zsh/Fish scripts and a PowerShell loader. Shell activation remains user-controlled; see below. |

Custom release scripts keep generated files at
`$HOME/.aspire/completions/aspire.{bash,zsh,fish,ps1}`. Bash registration uses
`.bashrc` and the first existing login profile; a newly created `.bash_profile`
also sources `.bashrc`. Zsh registration uses `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc`, Fish uses
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/fish/conf.d/aspire-completions.fish`, and PowerShell
uses `$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts`. Entries are marked `Aspire CLI completions`.

`--skip-path` / `-SkipPath` and archive dogfood installs only generate an artifact
under `<CLI-directory>/completions`, with manual activation instructions. The explicitly
selected CLI directory can be outside the user home; artifact writes remain confined
to that directory and reject redirection outside it. A link explicitly selected as
the installation root anchors the boundary at its target; links below that root
cannot redirect artifact writes elsewhere. Package-manager dogfood modes
do not register profiles. Automatic profile writes and persistent user completion
files remain home-confined; redirected/symlinked profiles, elevated installs, unsupported shells,
older PowerShell engines, and signed profiles can require manual setup. `AllSigned`
policy leaves generated PowerShell files untouched as well. Installers report the
reason and do not change execution policy. Older CLIs without the generation command
leave working completion files intact.

Shell functions cannot be installed into a parent process by its child installer.
Open a new shell or explicitly source the generated file to activate registration.
Reinstalling custom scripts updates their generated files without duplicating
registration. Removing the CLI does not remove user-owned profile entries: remove
the Aspire source block and generated completion file as well, without deleting
the rest of your profile. Saved scripts query the current CLI dynamically; regenerate
them when upgrading to a version that changes the shell integration protocol.

Local .NET tools (`dotnet aspire` / `dotnet tool run aspire`) and `npx` / `npm exec`
are different outer commands and are **not** completed by these hooks. A local npm
setup must remain scoped to a session with the intended `node_modules/.bin` on PATH.
Generating a script through a local-tool command does not add `aspire` to the parent
shell or register completion for `dotnet`.

Homebrew uses `etc/bash_completion.d/aspire`, `share/zsh/site-functions/_aspire`,
`share/fish/vendor_completions.d/aspire.fish`, and
`share/pwsh/completions/_aspire.ps1` under `brew --prefix`. Configure your shell's
Homebrew completion paths/loader as described in
[Homebrew's shell completion documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion).
For PowerShell, explicitly dot-source the generated file in your chosen profile:

```powershell
. (Join-Path (brew --prefix) 'share/pwsh/completions/_aspire.ps1')
```

This PowerShell file is a loader that gets the current script from `aspire` when
sourced. Homebrew installs it as a managed artifact so fresh prefixes do not depend
on the completion generator's sandbox being able to create `share/pwsh`.

Homebrew removes its files on uninstall, but not your profile entry. Its native
completion generator has no completion-specific opt-out; custom installer flags
do not apply to Homebrew. No installer should change machine-wide profiles or
shell execution policies.

## Browser certificate trust configuration

On Linux, the NSS databases used to trust the Aspire development certificate can be configured locally or in the user-level Aspire configuration:

```bash
aspire config set --global certificates.nssDbPaths "firefox=/path/to/firefox/profile:chromium=/path/to/chromium/nssdb"
```

Prefix a path with `firefox=` or `chromium=` to apply the trust settings expected by that browser family.

The `certificates.nssDbPaths` setting takes precedence over the upstream `DOTNET_DEV_CERTS_NSSDB_PATHS` environment variable. When the Aspire setting has no value, the CLI preserves the upstream behavior.
