# Radius hosting integration

Use this integration to publish and deploy an Aspire AppHost's applications to a [Radius](https://radapp.io) compute environment.

`AddRadiusEnvironment` is an Aspire **compute environment**, the same kind of building block as
`AddKubernetesEnvironment`, `AddDockerComposeEnvironment`, and `AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment`.
Add it to your AppHost, keep your existing resource graph unchanged, and target it with the standard
`aspire publish` / `aspire deploy` lifecycle — Radius becomes just another target you
deploy to, with no changes to how you declare `AddContainer`, `AddProject`, `AddRedis`, and friends.
Radius participates only at publish/deploy time; `aspire run` continues to run your app locally as usual.

> **Preview / prototype.** This integration is an early prototype. The public API surface and the generated Bicep contract may change in future versions. Pin the integration version in `AppHost.csproj` and avoid taking dependencies on any internal types.

This README is layered by intent:

* **Getting started** — the happy path: add the environment, run, publish, deploy.
* **Deploying to a cloud** — Azure/AWS providers and credentials.
* **Production & platform features** — secret stores, multiple resource groups, resource/recipe customization.
* **Reference** — supported resources, diagnostics, and known limitations.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* **Radius v0.59.0 or later.** This integration is developed and verified against Radius **v0.59.0** and up; the generated Bicep (resource types, `secretStores`, and `recipeConfig`) targets the schemas shipped in that release. Older Radius versions are not supported.
* A Kubernetes cluster (for example `kind`, `minikube`, AKS) with [Radius](https://docs.radapp.io/installation/) installed.
* The `rad` CLI on PATH. Version must match the pinned Radius Bicep extension this integration emits (currently `0.59`). Run `rad version` to check.
* `rad init` has been run against the target cluster so the workspace and environment exist.

### Add the integration

From your AppHost directory, add the `Aspire.Hosting.Radius` integration with the Aspire CLI:

```bash
aspire add Aspire.Hosting.Radius
```

## Quick start

In the _AppHost.cs_ file of `AppHost`, add the environment:

**C#**

```csharp
builder.AddRadiusEnvironment("radius");
```

**TypeScript**

```typescript
await builder.addRadiusEnvironment("radius");
```

That single line is all you add — your existing resource declarations stay the same. The standard
Aspire lifecycle still works; Radius participates only in publish and deploy:

| Command | What happens |
|---------|--------------|
| `aspire run` | Runs your app locally as usual. Radius does no run-mode wiring — the Radius environment is inert during local development and takes effect only at publish/deploy. |
| `aspire publish` | Generates `app.bicep` plus a `bicepconfig.json` pinned to the Radius extension version. |
| `aspire deploy` | Invokes `rad deploy` against the generated Bicep — no direct `rad` knowledge needed for the happy path. |

Publish and deploy:

```shell
aspire publish -o radius-artifacts
aspire deploy
```

### Local development with `aspire run`

Radius is a publish/deploy-only target: `aspire run` builds and runs your app locally exactly as it
would without Radius, using the normal Aspire dashboard for your resources. The Radius environment
does not attach annotations or alter your resources during local development — Radius wiring happens
when you `aspire publish` / `aspire deploy`. You iterate locally as usual, then publish/deploy the
same application resources to a cluster.

### Multiple compute environments

When the model contains more than one compute environment (for example a Radius environment alongside a Kubernetes one), explicitly assign each resource to the environment that should publish it:

```csharp
var radius = builder.AddRadiusEnvironment("radius");
var k8s    = builder.AddKubernetesEnvironment("k8s");

builder.AddContainer("api", "myorg/api", "1.0")
       .WithComputeEnvironment(radius);
```

Untargeted resources surface a clear error from the core pipeline instead of being silently claimed by one environment.

## Deploying to a cloud

Everything above works against a plain Kubernetes cluster with Radius installed. To target Azure
and/or AWS resources, configure the providers in the AppHost.

### Cloud providers

Configure Azure and/or AWS cloud providers directly in the AppHost. The publisher
emits the provider configuration on the `Radius.Core/environments` resource using the
native schema's discrete fields — `properties.providers.azure.subscriptionId` /
`properties.providers.azure.resourceGroupName` for Azure and
`properties.providers.aws.accountId` / `properties.providers.aws.region` for AWS
(the legacy `Applications.Core/environments` schema instead used a single `scope`
path) — and the deploy pipeline registers credentials via `rad credential register`
before `rad deploy` runs.

```csharp
var clientSecret = builder.AddParameter("azure-sp-secret", secret: true);

builder.AddRadiusEnvironment("radius")
       .WithAzureProvider(
           subscriptionId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
           resourceGroup:  "rg-radius",
           azure => azure.WithServicePrincipal(
               tenantId:     "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
               clientId:     "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222",
               clientSecret: clientSecret))
       .WithAwsProvider(
           accountId: "123456789012",
           region:    "us-west-2",
           aws => aws.WithIrsa("arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/radius-irsa"));
```

Supported credential modes:

| Provider | Mode | Method |
|----------|------|--------|
| Azure | Service Principal | `azure.WithServicePrincipal(tenantId, clientId, clientSecret)` |
| Azure | Workload Identity | `azure.WithWorkloadIdentity(tenantId, clientId)` |
| AWS   | Access Key        | `aws.WithAccessKey(accessKeyId, secretAccessKey)` |
| AWS   | IRSA              | `aws.WithIrsa(iamRoleArn)` |

Cloud-provider credential secret material (Azure SP client secret, AWS access-key pair) must be supplied
via `builder.AddParameter(..., secret: true)`. The integration never inlines
those credential values into Bicep or manifests; `rad credential register` resolves them during
deploy and redacts them from any logged command line. Secret Aspire parameters used in container
environment variables are emitted as `@secure()` Bicep parameters (never literals) and their values
are supplied to `rad deploy` separately, not by this credential-registration path.

> **Security note:** `rad credential register` accepts credential secrets only as command-line
> arguments, so during registration those resolved values are briefly visible to other users on the
> same host via the process table (`ps` / `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`). Log redaction does not mitigate
> this local, transient exposure. Deploy-time secret parameters do not share this concern — they are
> written to an owner-only temporary parameters file rather than the command line.

See the [Radius cloud providers documentation](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/deploy/environments/cloud-providers/)
for an end-to-end walkthrough.

## Production & platform features

The features below are power/enterprise capabilities for platform teams. They are opt-in and not
needed for a standard single-app deploy — reach for them when your topology demands it.

### Recipe parameters

Flow platform values into the [Radius recipes](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/recipes/) that
provision your backing resources with `WithRecipeParameters`. Parameters can be set environment-wide
(applied to every recipe in the environment) or scoped to a specific Radius resource type
(resource-type-scoped values win on key collision):

```csharp
var radius = builder.AddRadiusEnvironment("radius")
    // Environment-wide: applied to every recipe.
    .WithRecipeParameters(p => p["region"] = "eastus")
    // Scoped to one resource type; overrides the environment-wide value on collision.
    .WithRecipeParameters("Radius.Data/redisCaches", p => p["sku"] = "Premium");
```

- **Type fidelity** — numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects are emitted with their Bicep types
  (a `6379` stays a number, not `'6379'`).
- **Aspire parameters flow as `@secure()` params, never literals** — binding an
  `AddParameter(..., secret: true)` value emits a valueless secure Bicep `param` and passes the
  resolved value at deploy time (`rad deploy --parameters`), so no secret lands in the artifact.
- **Provider references** — reuse a configured cloud provider's scope without re-declaring it, e.g.
  `p["region"] = RadiusProviderReference.AwsRegion`. Referencing a provider that is not configured
  fails at publish with a message naming the missing provider.
- A parameter scoped to a resource type with no emitted recipe is ignored with a warning; the
  publish still succeeds.

### Secret management

> **Experimental** — the secret-store APIs are gated by `ASPIRERADIUS006`. Suppress the
> diagnostic (`#pragma warning disable ASPIRERADIUS006`) to opt in.

Declare a Radius secret store (`Applications.Core/secretStores`) and populate it in exactly one
of three ways:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable ASPIRERADIUS006

// Inline — Radius-created from Aspire secret parameters (@secure() params, redacted at deploy).
var user = builder.AddParameter("db-user", secret: true);
var pass = builder.AddParameter("db-pass", secret: true);
builder.AddRadiusSecretStore("db-creds", RadiusSecretStoreType.BasicAuthentication)
       .WithData(d => { d.Add("username", user); d.Add("password", pass); });

// For a single key there is a convenience overload:
//   builder.AddRadiusSecretStore("api", RadiusSecretStoreType.Generic).WithData("api-key", apiKey);

// Reference an existing cluster Secret (external operator / hand-applied).
radius.WithSecretStore("tls-cert", RadiusSecretStoreType.Certificate, s =>
    s.WithExistingSecret("app/tls-cert", "tls.crt", "tls.key"));

// GitOps sealed secrets — the encrypted manifest is applied before rad deploy and awaited.
radius.WithSecretStore("db-creds", RadiusSecretStoreType.BasicAuthentication, s =>
    s.WithSealedSecret("./secrets/db-creds.sealed.yaml", "username", "password"));
```

- **Scope is implied by the API form**: `builder.AddRadiusSecretStore(...)` is application-scoped
  (`properties.application`); `radius.WithSecretStore(...)` is environment-scoped
  (`properties.environment`).
- **Encoding** defaults to `base64` for `certificate` stores and `raw` otherwise.
- **Sealed secrets** require `kubectl` on `PATH` and the Bitnami Sealed Secrets controller in the
  target cluster; the integration applies the already-encrypted manifest (it never runs
  `kubeseal`) and polls for the materialized `Secret` (default 120s, overridable via
  `WithMaterializationTimeout`, which applies to sealed stores only — `ASPIRERADIUS062`).
- **Consume** a store from `recipeConfig` auth / `envSecrets` via
  `WithBicepRegistryAuthentication` / `WithTerraformGitAuthentication` /
  `WithRecipeEnvironmentSecret`, referenced by the store's `.id`.

## Reference

### Supported resources

* `AddContainer(...)` — published as a Radius container workload (`Radius.Compute/containers`).
* `AddProject<T>(...)` — published as a Radius container workload only when the project has a pre-built image attached with `WithContainerImage("<registry>/<image>:<tag>")`. Without one, `aspire publish` fails with a remediation message to build and push an image the cluster can pull.
* Selected resources with a Radius mapping (e.g. Redis, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Dapr building blocks) emit Radius "legacy" types via the resource type mapper. Child database resources (for example `AddSqlServer("sql").AddDatabase("appdb")`) are collapsed onto the parent today.

Other Aspire resource types are not emitted; only the resources listed above appear in the generated Bicep.

### Diagnostics

The package uses the `ASPIRERADIUS` diagnostic prefix for two mechanisms: compile-time
`[Experimental]` gates on preview APIs, and runtime configuration/publish validation errors.

| Code | Mechanism | Surfaced as |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `ASPIRERADIUS003` | Experimental gate on the cloud-provider surface (`WithAzureProvider` / `WithAwsProvider` and their credential callbacks) | `[Experimental]` warning (suppressible), documented at `https://aka.ms/aspire/diagnostics/<id>` |
| `ASPIRERADIUS004` | Experimental gate on the `ConfigureRadiusInfrastructure` escape hatch and its construct types | `[Experimental]` warning (suppressible) |
| `ASPIRERADIUS006` | Experimental gate on the secret-store surface (`AddRadiusSecretStore` / `WithSecretStore` and their population/consumer callbacks) | `[Experimental]` warning (suppressible) |
| `ASPIRERADIUS057` | Experimental gate on `WithContainerImage` | `[Experimental]` warning (suppressible) |

Runtime validation codes:

| Code | When | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| `ASPIRERADIUS010` | Provider config | A cloud-provider credential callback did not select a credential. |
| `ASPIRERADIUS011` | Provider config | Conflicting cloud-provider credentials across environments sharing a Radius installation. |
| `ASPIRERADIUS028` | Publish | Two recipe parameters bound to distinct Aspire parameters whose names sanitize to the same Bicep identifier. Rename one so they produce distinct identifiers. |
| `ASPIRERADIUS040`–`ASPIRERADIUS052`, `ASPIRERADIUS055`, `ASPIRERADIUS058`–`ASPIRERADIUS059`, `ASPIRERADIUS061`–`ASPIRERADIUS068` | Secret-store (`AddRadiusSecretStore` / `WithSecretStore`) validation, publish, and deploy | Thrown `ArgumentException` (call site, e.g. empty/invalid name or key) / `InvalidOperationException` (fail-fast validation gate, publish, or deploy). Key codes: `041` (declare exactly one population mode — the zero-mode case), `044` (`WithSealedSecret` manifest missing/unreadable, malformed, ambiguous/duplicate-key, plaintext-capable, missing a non-empty `spec.encryptedData` mapping of standard-base64 sealed values, or not a single encrypted Bitnami `SealedSecret`), `045` (`kubectl` not on `PATH`), `046` (`WithExistingSecret` reference is not a valid `[namespace/]name` — each segment must be a DNS-1123 label/subdomain), `051` (a secret-store consumer is incompatible with the referenced store — e.g. Bicep-registry auth requires a `basicAuthentication` (username/password) store, and Terraform Git PAT auth requires a store that declares a `pat` key), `052` (a key-specific `envSecrets` consumer references a key a non-empty declared key set does not contain), `058` (the sealed `Secret` did not materialize before deploy: the Sealed Secrets controller never reported `Synced` for the applied `SealedSecret` generation — the controller must have status updates enabled, i.e. not `--update-status=false` / Helm `updateStatus: false`), `059` (the active `rad` workspace's Kubernetes context could not be resolved; publish/deploy fails closed rather than applying the `SealedSecret` to `kubectl`'s ambient context — configure the active `rad` workspace or set the `ASPIRE_RADIUS_KUBE_CONTEXT` override), `061` (the materialized sealed `Secret` is missing a declared key), `062` (`WithMaterializationTimeout` was set on a store that is not populated with `WithSealedSecret`), `063` (a `WithSealedSecret` manifest embeds a plaintext `kind: Secret` inside a `last-applied-configuration` annotation), `064` (a key-specific `envSecrets` consumer references a store that declares no keys), `065` (a secret store's population was declared more than once — repeated or cross-mode `WithData`/`WithExistingSecret`/`WithSealedSecret`), `066` (a bounded `kubectl` apply/verify operation exceeded the store's materialization budget and was cancelled), `067` (a secret data key is not a valid Kubernetes Secret key — only alphanumeric characters, `-`, `_`, or `.`, at most 253 characters, and not `.`/`..`), `068` (an application-scoped store was declared but the model contains no Radius environment to emit and deploy it — add one with `AddRadiusEnvironment`). Note: `056` (Bicep identifier collision) and `057` (`WithContainerImage` experimental) are separate diagnostics documented in their own rows, and codes `053`/`054`/`060` are retired. |
| `ASPIRERADIUS056` | Publish | Two emitted constructs map to the same Bicep identifier (e.g. a resource named `app` or `recipepack` colliding with a synthesized construct, or two resource names that sanitize to the same identifier such as `my-x` and `my.x`). Bicep symbols share one flat namespace; rename the conflicting resource. |

### Known limitations

* For `ASPIRERADIUS011`, AWS access-key credential conflicts are compared by the Aspire parameter name that supplies the access-key ID, not by the resolved access-key value. Two environments that use different parameter names for the same key can be flagged as a false conflict, while the same parameter name with different values is not flagged.
* Application-scoped sealed secret stores are applied by every Radius environment. A benign concurrent re-apply of the same manifest (for example, two environments sharing one store) is tolerated: the wait syncs against the latest live `SealedSecret` generation and verifies the declared keys materialize. It does not, however, compare the live `SealedSecret`'s encrypted values against the manifest this deployment applied, so a concurrent writer that replaces the encrypted values while preserving the same key names (only possible if a distinct manifest collides on the same namespace/name) would not be detected.
* Recipe customization (per-instance recipes via `PublishAsRadiusResource`), multiple Radius resource groups, and cloud-managed resources are not part of this release; they are planned for follow-up releases.
