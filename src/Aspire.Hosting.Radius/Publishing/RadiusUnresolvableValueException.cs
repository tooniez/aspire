/// The env-var resolution loop in <c>RadiusInfrastructureBuilder</c> used to wrap every value in

/// genuine publish errors, so whether a bug surfaced depended on the exception's <em>type</em>

/// The two cases the publisher does intend to skip both raise <see cref="InvalidOperationException"/>

/// <item>A reference to an endpoint that is not defined on the target resource

/// <c>"...has no value..."</c> until the deployment that produces it has run. Radius cannot
/// deploy those resources, so the value is genuinely unavailable at publish time. The skip is
/// gated on the value positively declaring deployment-substituted semantics by implementing

/// It derives from <see cref="InvalidOperationException"/> to match the package's publish-time
/// failure convention (the same convention <c>RadiusBackingResourceProjectionException</c>
