/// <summary>
/// Resolves per-replica HMP v1 producer streams by walking the live resource
/// snapshot stream from <see cref="IDashboardClient"/>. The dashboard receives
/// the consumer UDS path inside each replica snapshot's properties; this
/// resolver looks up the requested resource by display name + replica index and
/// connects to the matching local socket.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>The path itself is included in the gRPC stream from the AppHost. In Aspire's
/// single-user, single-machine local-dev scenario the path is not a privileged
/// secret (the user already controls the AppHost process and can read or write
/// anything in its temp directory), but the path never reaches the browser via
/// the terminal WebSocket because the proxy takes only
/// <c>resource</c>/<c>replica</c> identifiers.</para>
/// <para>The resolver intentionally does <i>not</i> use Hex1b's
/// <c>WithHmp1UdsClient</c> builder. That builder is for in-process Hex1b
/// applications that want to <i>embed</i> the HMP1 stream into a Hex1b
/// terminal (the CLI's <c>aspire terminal attach</c> path does exactly that).
/// The dashboard never instantiates a Hex1b terminal — it is a byte-level
/// proxy between the browser's HMP1 client and the remote terminal host —
/// so the resolver only needs the raw stream and reaches for the lower-level
/// <see cref="Hmp1Transports.ConnectUnixSocket"/> helper instead.</para>
