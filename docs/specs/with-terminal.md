# `WithTerminal()` — Aspire interactive terminal architecture

**Status:** Implemented for Aspire 13.4 (Windows executables).
**Issue:** [microsoft/aspire#16317](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/16317)
**DCP integration:** [microsoft/dcp#133](https://github.com/microsoft/dcp/pull/133)

## Goal

Let an Aspire AppHost author opt any executable or container resource into
interactive terminal access:

```csharp
builder.AddProject<Projects.MyAgent>("agent")
    .WithReplicas(2)
    .WithTerminal();
```

The dashboard then renders a Hex1b web terminal per replica, and the CLI
exposes the same session as `aspire terminal agent --replica 0`.

All terminal APIs share the experimental diagnostic `ASPIRETERMINAL001`,
including `WithTerminal()`, AppHost-owned terminals, and terminal interactions.

## AppHost-owned terminals

For processes that the AppHost launches directly rather than as resources, use
the experimental `TerminalService` API (`ASPIRETERMINAL001`).
`TerminalLaunchOptions` holds the executable, arguments, working directory,
environment variables, initial grid dimensions, title, and dashboard placement:

```csharp
using Aspire.Hosting.Terminals;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

#pragma warning disable ASPIRETERMINAL001

var terminalService = app.Services.GetRequiredService<TerminalService>();
var terminal = terminalService.CreateTerminal(new TerminalLaunchOptions
{
    Title = "Shell",
    Executable = "/bin/zsh",
    Arguments = ["-i", "-l"],
    WorkingDirectory = builder.AppHostDirectory,
    EnvironmentVariables =
    {
        ["MY_SETTING"] = "value"
    },
    Columns = 120,
    Rows = 32,
    Placement = TerminalPlacement.Dock
});
terminal.Start();
terminal.Show();
```

Here, `app` is the built `DistributedApplication`. Environment entries add to or
override the AppHost's inherited environment. Initial dimensions default to 80
columns and 24 rows. The process starts at the requested size, which headless
terminals retain. Dock and interaction dialog viewers resize the grid to fit
their available space when shown.
Placement defaults to the dock;
use `Dialog` for terminal interactions or `None` for automation-only terminals.

`CreateTerminal` captures the executable, arguments, working directory, and
environment overrides immediately. Mutating or reusing the launch options later
does not change an existing terminal, even before its lazy workload starts.

The creator owns the terminal. A dock terminal can outlive the command that
created it: closing its tab or shutting down the AppHost disposes it. For a
dialog-scoped terminal, use `await using` around creation and the interaction;
closing the interaction alone does not dispose the terminal.

`DistributedApplication.StopAsync()` stops and awaits all AppHost-owned terminals,
including terminals already closing in the background. Closing a terminal removes
it from discovery immediately, but the service retains teardown ownership until
cleanup finishes. Dashboard close waits at most 10 seconds; a timeout or disconnect
ends only that wait, not cleanup. Host-stop cancellation likewise bounds the wait,
and subsequent AppHost disposal joins the same cleanup operation.
The dashboard's `CloseTerminal` RPC accepts only AppHost-owned dock terminals.
It rejects `Dialog`, `None`, and resource-owned handles with `InvalidArgument`,
preserving caller-owned lifetimes and shared resource automation peers.

### Sending keys from AppHost code

`AspireTerminal.SendKeyAsync` accepts an immutable `AspireTerminalKey` value.
Named properties represent individual keys, and the static `Ctrl`, `Shift`, and
`Alt` methods on that same type add modifiers:

```csharp
await terminal.SendKeyAsync(AspireTerminalKey.F5, cancellationToken);
await terminal.SendKeyAsync(
    AspireTerminalKey.Ctrl(AspireTerminalKey.R), cancellationToken);
await terminal.SendKeyAsync(
    AspireTerminalKey.Shift(AspireTerminalKey.Tab), cancellationToken);
await terminal.SendKeyAsync(
    AspireTerminalKey.Ctrl(AspireTerminalKey.Shift(AspireTerminalKey.Left)),
    cancellationToken);
```

The catalog includes `A`-`Z`, `D0`-`D9`, `F1`-`F12`, navigation and editing keys,
`Space`, and punctuation keys such as `EqualsSign`, `LeftBracket`, and
`Apostrophe`. Letters are lowercase unless shifted; digits and punctuation use
US-layout key pairs. Use `SendTextAsync` for arbitrary text and Unicode rather
than treating these keys as a keyboard-layout abstraction.

Modifier composition is order-independent and idempotent: `Ctrl(Shift(R))`
and `Shift(Ctrl(R))` describe the same keypress. It does not hold modifiers down
for subsequent calls. `default(AspireTerminalKey)` is invalid and is rejected
before starting a workload or connecting to a resource terminal.

Both AppHost-owned and resource-owned terminals use the same key semantics.
Encoding honors application-cursor mode for arrows, Home, and End. This is
terminal input, not OS keyboard injection: legacy encoding cannot distinguish
Control+I from Tab, Control+M from Enter, or Control+Shift+C from Control+C.
Windows workloads receive input through ConPTY and may interpret it differently.
Numeric-keypad keys, extended modifiers, key-down/up events, and Kitty keyboard
protocol are not part of this API. Typing text is not bracketed paste.

Key and text input report caller cancellation as `OperationCanceledException`
with the caller's token, including when Hex1b wraps a canceled input step.
Canceling an input operation does not dispose the terminal; later input remains
usable. Unrelated automation failures are not converted to cancellation.

Public C# lookup currently requires a terminal ID. A resource-name/replica lookup
API that avoids constructing internal IDs is deferred to
[#20219](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/20219).

On a newly connected resource terminal, the first mode-dependent key can race
initial state replay. Await expected screen text before mode-sensitive input
when necessary; a replay-completion barrier is tracked in
[mitchdenny/hex1b#551](https://github.com/mitchdenny/hex1b/issues/551).

### Terminal interactions

`IInteractionService.PromptTerminalAsync` displays one caller-owned terminal in
a dedicated dialog, following progress-interaction completion and cancellation
semantics. It is experimental under the same `ASPIRETERMINAL001` diagnostic.
The public API uses only Aspire types, not Hex1b types.

```csharp
var interactions = app.Services.GetRequiredService<IInteractionService>();
await using var terminal = terminalService.CreateTerminal(new TerminalLaunchOptions
{
    Title = "Setup",
    Executable = "./setup.sh",
    Placement = TerminalPlacement.Dialog
});
terminal.Start();
var result = await interactions.PromptTerminalAsync(
    "Running setup.", terminal,
    new TerminalInteractionOptions
    {
        Title = "Setup",
        PrimaryButtonText = "Cancel",
        Work = async context =>
        {
            await terminal.WaitForTextAsync("Continue? ", cancellationToken: context.CancellationToken);
            await terminal.SendTextAsync("y\r", context.CancellationToken);
            await terminal.WaitForTextAsync("Setup complete", cancellationToken: context.CancellationToken);
        }
    },
    cancellationToken);
```

- The supplied terminal must use `Dialog` placement and be the exact instance
  still registered with the same AppHost. A foreign, disposed, or merely
  same-ID handle is rejected. Attachment also checks availability.
- Successful `Work` completion closes the dialog and returns a successful
  `InteractionResult<bool>`. The optional primary button requests cancellation;
  it is not a form submit/accept button. Secondary and dismiss actions are hidden.
- User or external cancellation closes the dialog, signals
  `TerminalContext.CancellationToken`, and waits for `Work` to finish before
  returning a canceled result. A pre-canceled caller token throws before
  publishing. Other callback failures remove the interaction and propagate.
- Without `Work`, the interaction waits for explicit completion, user
  cancellation (when a button is configured), or external cancellation.
  **Process exit does not close the dialog.**
- The caller starts and owns the terminal. Completion, cancellation, viewer
  disposal, and dashboard disconnect never stop or dispose the producer.
  Disconnecting only releases that viewer; the pending interaction can be
  redisplayed on reconnect. The caller can reuse the terminal in later prompts.
- The dialog contains a chromeless terminal with its existing font/footer
  controls, no duplicate title bar or launch button, and a wider viewport than
  ordinary input dialogs. It uses the PathBase-aware AppHost terminal endpoint.

Three actors and three socket roles:

| Actor          | Socket              | Direction                        | Lifetime |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| **DCP**        | `producerUdsPath`   | DCP → host (PTY bytes + control) | Per replica |
| **TerminalHost** | `consumerUdsPath` | host → consumers (broadcast)     | Per replica |
| **TerminalHost** | `controlUdsPath`  | AppHost → host (lifecycle, stats)| Per replica |

The producer/consumer split lets multiple consumers (dashboard + multiple CLI
sessions) attach simultaneously without coupling DCP to consumer counts.

## Wire protocol

We do **not** define a custom protocol. The terminal traffic uses
[Hex1b](https://github.com/dotnet/hex1b)'s `HMP v1` (Hex Multiplex Protocol,
version 1), which already handles:

- VT byte streaming with backpressure
- Resize requests in both directions
- Hello/StateSync replay so a late-attaching consumer sees the current
  scrollback
- Connection lifecycle (close, disconnect, reconnect)
- Authenticated stream factory hooks for Unix sockets and the AppHost's
  dashboard gRPC terminal stream

The terminal host uses `DcpUpstreamAdapter` for DCP's minimal single-peer
protocol and `Hmp1PresentationAdapter` for its consumer-facing listener.
The dashboard and CLI attach using `Hmp1WorkloadAdapter`. The dashboard
adds a per-browser `Hex1bTerminal` mirror with `Hwt1PresentationAdapter`;
the browser receives authoritative terminal state rather than parsing ANSI.

### Resize and reflow

AppHost-owned terminals and resource terminal hosts explicitly enable
`GhosttyReflowStrategy.Instance` on their HMP presentation adapters. Dashboard
HWT replicas and headless automation replicas use the same policy: HMP preserves
soft wraps during replay but does not negotiate the reflow strategy.
No browser-side reflow setting is required.

Resizing rewraps soft continuations while preserving hard line breaks, cursor
positions and retained history. Producers and dashboard replicas retain up to
10,000 physical rows of scrollback, so narrowing can evict the oldest rows at
that limit. Fresh HMP replicas receive the current screen and accumulate history
after attachment, not the producer's entire pre-existing scrollback.
Alternate-screen layouts still crop on resize; the saved main screen reflows
when the application returns to it. Primary-peer resize authority is unchanged.
See [Hex1b's reflow configuration](https://github.com/mitchdenny/hex1b/blob/093b67b/docs/web-terminal.md#shell-reflow-configuration).

## Property contract (gRPC `ResourceService` snapshots)

When `WithTerminal()` is applied to a resource, every replica snapshot
emitted by the dashboard service carries four properties:

| Key                       | Sensitivity     | Meaning                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `terminal.enabled`        | non-sensitive   | Marker. `"true"` when the replica has a PTY. |
| `terminal.replicaIndex`   | non-sensitive   | 0-based stable index from `DcpInstancesAnnotation`. |
| `terminal.replicaCount`   | non-sensitive   | Total replicas for the parent resource.      |
| `terminal.consumerUdsPath`| **sensitive**   | The local UDS that consumers connect to.     |

The consumer UDS path is marked `IsSensitive=true` so the dashboard UI masks
the value in the property list. The path still rides the gRPC stream because
the dashboard's WebSocket proxy needs it server-side to resolve
`?resource=&replica=` query parameters into a real socket; the path is never
echoed back to the browser.

## Dashboard `/api/terminal` WebSocket endpoint

Authenticated (`RequireAuthorization(FrontendAuthorizationDefaults.PolicyName)`)
endpoint at `/api/terminal?resource=<displayName>&replica=<index>`.

`TerminalWebSocketProxy` resolves the connection entirely server-side:

1. The same-origin WebSocket gate rejects missing or cross-origin `Origin`
   headers before resolving a resource, in addition to frontend authorization.
2. `ITerminalConnectionResolver.ConnectAsync(resourceName, replicaIndex, ct)`
   walks `IDashboardClient.GetResources()`, matches by `DisplayName` +
   `TryGetTerminalReplicaInfo`, and connects via
   `Hmp1Transports.ConnectUnixSocket(consumerUdsPath, ct)`.
3. The handler connects a public `Hmp1WorkloadAdapter`, attaches a per-view
   terminal and `Hwt1PresentationAdapter`, and runs the two transport pumps.
   Incoming UTF-8 JSON messages are reassembled up to 64 KiB and passed to
   `HandleMessageAsync`. Each `ReadFrameAsync` result is sent as one complete
   binary WebSocket message, without dropping or reordering frames.
4. Hex1b owns input encoding, primary-role negotiation, selection, history,
   graphics projection, acknowledgements and state resynchronization. The
   dashboard bounds handshake and send times and cancels both pumps when
   either transport ends. Disposing a view disconnects only that peer, not
   the AppHost-owned producer.

The browser never sees `consumerUdsPath` and cannot induce the dashboard
to connect to an arbitrary local socket — it can only ask for
`(resource, replica)` pairs that are present in the resource snapshot
stream.

### AppHost-owned terminal views

`/api/apphost-terminal?terminalId=<id>` uses the same frontend authorization,
same-origin validation, and HWT presentation bridge. Its upstream is the opaque
HMP byte stream from `AttachTerminal`, tunneled over the existing dashboard
gRPC connection. Closing a viewer releases only that attachment; the creator
continues to own the terminal.

An authoritative gRPC `Ended` notification, or a `NotFound`/`FailedPrecondition`
rejection of an AppHost terminal ID, closes the viewer's WebSocket with
Aspire's private application close code `4000`, including completion before the
initial HMP handshake. This is an Aspire endpoint contract, not a Hex1b close
code or an Aspire-specific HWT message. The browser observes it through native
`onClose` and leaves the tab or dialog visible without reconnecting. Completion
before the first frame can leave an empty view; an already mounted view keeps
its last available projection, without guaranteeing a final frame. Normal
closure (`1000`), abnormal transport loss (`1006`), close reason strings, and
`wasClean` do not indicate producer completion and remain retryable. Transient
gRPC attachment failures such as `Unavailable` retain HTTP 503 responses; a
resource replica that is not yet available retains HTTP 404. Neither marks the
producer as ended.

Each component registers a separate input policy with the dashboard and passes
its opaque `viewId` with the WebSocket URL. Changes to a view's read-only
state update that policy before updating browser input behavior. The bridge
applies `Hwt1PresentationAdapter.IsReadOnly` before dispatching each complete
command, delegating validation and input gating to Hex1b. The browser uses
`setReadOnly` without remounting; native gating also cancels held pointers,
queued gestures and pending clipboard pastes, including direct paste/action
calls. Read-only views retain output, acknowledgements, selection, copy, and
history while connected. Already accepted or in-flight commands cannot be recalled.
This is a per-view presentation policy, not a new user authorization boundary:
it does not lock the terminal, its creator's automation, or other viewers.

### Browser requirements and package pairing

The dashboard uses `@hex1b/web-terminal` and the `Hex1b` NuGet package at
exactly `0.168.0`. HWT1 is experimental state transfer
between these paired packages, not a stable wire contract implemented by
Aspire. Upgrade both together. The full npm `dist` tree is vendored, including
module workers, relative imports, fonts and licenses.

The dashboard uses the package's automatic renderer selection: WebGPU is
preferred, with WebGL2 used when WebGPU capabilities or device acquisition are
unavailable. WebGPU requires a secure context (HTTPS or localhost); WebGL2 can
render on ordinary HTTP. Clipboard API restrictions still apply, and renderer
selection does not relax transport security, authorization or origin checks.
Both backends require OffscreenCanvas and module workers. Initialization and
runtime rendering failures remain visible errors; there is no xterm.js fallback.
Sixel and Kitty Graphics Protocol are rendered
from server-authoritative state. Historical rendering is text-only. The
dashboard's independent console-log view remains available.

Text selections use a translucent Aspire accent highlight. A compact Fluent copy
button appears only when more than one terminal cell is selected, so clicking to
focus does not show it. It appears below and to the right of the last visible
selected line, clamping to the canvas edges and moving above the line when there
is not enough room below.
The dashboard uses Hex1b's public selection overlay and copy action; Hex1b retains
ownership of authoritative selection text, history and clipboard handling.
After a successful copy, the selection and copy overlay are cleared and focus
returns to the terminal, ready for Cmd+V or Ctrl+V. A failed copy leaves the
selection available for retry.
Selections invalidated by resizing, reflow or changed/evicted output are cleared
through Hex1b's public selection callback without showing its selection-expired
message.

HMP checkpoints retain uploaded Kitty image data even when an animation
temporarily removes its placements. They also preserve partially received ANSI
sequences, so late and reconnected viewers can resume placement-only updates
without losing pixels or displaying fragments of graphics commands. See the
[graphics and partial-sequence replay fix](https://github.com/mitchdenny/hex1b/pull/496).

The package handles Ctrl/Cmd+click on authoritative OSC 8 hyperlinks in live
output and history. HMP state replay preserves link destinations across late
attachment and reconnect. It only opens absolute HTTP, HTTPS and mailto destinations
with `noopener,noreferrer`; plain clicks and drags retain selection/application
behavior. Aspire adds no custom opener or plain-text URL detection. See the
[hyperlink PR](https://github.com/mitchdenny/hex1b/pull/489),
[renderer PR](https://github.com/mitchdenny/hex1b/pull/491), and
[hyperlink replay fix](https://github.com/mitchdenny/hex1b/pull/493).

### Console / Terminal view toggle

For a terminal-enabled resource the dashboard `ConsoleLogs` page mounts
**both** `LogViewer` (the resource's standard log stream) and
`TerminalView` (the interactive Hex1b web terminal) at the same time and
flips between them via a pair of **Console logs** / **Terminal** items
rendered inside the toolbar's options (⋯) `AspireMenuButton`:

- The page defaults to **Console** on resource selection so any pre-PTY
  hosting messages — `WaitFor` notifications, startup failures, image
  pull progress — are visible immediately.
- The view is purely user-controlled: the page never auto-switches
  between Console and Terminal. The user picks the view from the ⋯
  menu and the page stays on that view until they pick the other one,
  or a different resource is selected (which resets to Console).
- Both views stay mounted across flips (visibility is toggled with
  `display:none` on a wrapper `<div>`); the log subscription and the
  Hex1b/HMP1 consumer session are kept alive so neither view loses
  scrollback or has to re-handshake on toggle. After a `display:none →
  visible` transition the page calls `refreshLayout` on the JS terminal
  to fit the terminal to the new available space.

The resource Terminal view offers an icon-only **Open in new window** button
at the right of its title bar, not in the page's Options menu or Console view.
The dock keeps its detach button in the tab strip; dialogs and detached windows
do not offer another launch button. Launch buttons stay disabled until their
native click listener, terminal key, complete URL, and font preference are ready.
The browser opens or focuses the named window before notifying Blazor, so a
pending server response cannot delay popup creation. Browser popup policy can
still block the launch, in which case the dashboard shows feedback.

Resource terminals keep their inline viewer while the extra window is open.
Dock terminals show a detached placeholder until the window closes or the user
chooses **Return to dock**. Disposing the opener leaves independent windows and
their AppHost-owned producers running.

Detached tracking survives launcher/circuit replacement and full same-origin
opener reload. Before mounting any dock viewer, the dashboard reconciles durable
records scoped to the browsing context, dashboard base, terminal, and window
generation. Detached windows announce their presence so the opener can recover
live handles without opening another window or changing terminal dimensions.
An unanswered discovery request does not prove closure: a window closed before
handle recovery leaves an unconfirmed placeholder until **Focus window** or
**Return to dock** is used. Focus reuses the named window through user activation;
Return revokes its generation so delayed discovery cannot restore the old window.

Adoption validates the complete record batch and discovery request before
transferring live-window ownership or acknowledging any detached pane. A failed
batch keeps the recovery placeholder rather than partially adopting windows.
Explicit Return always releases tracking and attempts to close a known live window, even
if durable storage cleanup fails. Corrupt records are removed when storage is
writable; storage failures remain visible through the dashboard's warning log.

The terminal frame keeps font decrease/increase buttons, the current font
size, and the live columns-by-rows selector together in its bottom-right
footer. A separate Fit button switches to container-sized rows and columns
without changing font size, and is disabled while the view is already the
auto-sized primary. The selector offers predefined terminal dimensions
and displays the current grid,
keeping both sizing operations available without opening the page options
menu. A terminal starts at 132×50. A viewer adopts the producer's current
dimensions. Ordinary keyboard and paste input do not take resize control;
explicit footer sizing actions request primary and wait for confirmation before
changing the grid. The bottom-left footer hint is shown only while the terminal
has focus. It advertises <kbd>F6</kbd>, which moves keyboard focus from terminal
input to the footer controls; <kbd>Shift+F6</kbd> moves focus to the preceding
dashboard control. Hiding the hint preserves its space so focus changes do not
resize the terminal or move the footer controls.

Dock tabs share the Resources/Parameters tab styling. The dock resize handle
uses the dashboard's Fluent splitter styling, including neutral gray hover,
drag and keyboard-focus feedback.

Press the backtick key (<kbd>`</kbd>), without Shift, to show or hide the terminal
dock. The help dialog lists this shortcut under **Site-wide navigation** only
when the resource service is enabled and the selected run is not read-only.
The shortcut is suppressed while a terminal or text input has focus so it
does not consume typed input. Press <kbd>F6</kbd> first to move from terminal input
to its footer controls before toggling the dock.

The desktop header also has a terminal toggle button. On mobile, open the
navigation menu and select **Terminal** to open, collapse, or reopen the
dock without a keyboard. Both controls are available only for writable live runs
with the resource service enabled, and are hidden while switching runs.

When the dock is empty, it lists links to terminal-enabled resources on their
resource pages. Resource terminals remain separate from AppHost-owned dock tabs.
As the empty panel shrinks, supplementary text and its icon are hidden first,
then the documentation link, then the backtick hint. The heading has highest
priority, and overflowing content remains scrollable from its beginning.
The documentation link uses the same text size as the surrounding copy.

Focused terminal input uses the same inset focus highlight as dashboard
textboxes, around the terminal's mount area rather than its title or footer.
The highlight is layered above the canvas so rendering cannot obscure it.
Moving focus to the footer or another control removes the highlight without
changing terminal dimensions.

Before the first opening, the dock watches only AppHost terminal metadata so
`Show()` can reveal it remotely. Resource-link tracking and browser controls start
on first opening; ordinary metadata updates do not render the unopened dock.
Window-launch buttons are enabled only once their native click listener, usable
terminal target, and font size are ready. Detached-window
tracking is initialized earlier, before dock viewers mount, so recovering a
detached tab does not briefly create a competing auto-fit viewer.

Dock panes, interaction dialogs and detached windows automatically fit when
opened. A detached window takes primary once, carrying the originating view's
selected font size rather than its grid dimensions. Its font preference can
then change independently of the opener. The active dock pane requests resize
control when revealed or returned from a detached window; inactive panes do not take it.
Container resizing then changes rows and columns, not the selected font size.
Read-only views cannot take resize control, and a view that loses primary to
another viewer does not automatically reclaim it.

Hex1b enforces a minimum grid of 20 columns by 10 rows. If the container is too
small for that grid at the selected font size, the renderer still scales the
text down to fit.

The console log stream is now subscribed to for terminal-enabled
resources too (previously it was suppressed), which is what makes the
Console view non-empty for a `WithTerminal()` resource.

## CLI

`aspire terminal attach <resource> [--replica N]` (`Aspire.Cli/Commands/TerminalAttachCommand.cs`)
opens its own `Hmp1WorkloadAdapter` against the consumer UDS path
returned by `IBackchannel.GetTerminalInfoAsync(resource, replica)` and
renders frames into the host terminal via Hex1b's `Hex1bTerminal`. When the
resource has more than one replica and the CLI is interactive, it prompts
for a selection; in non-interactive mode the `--replica` flag is required.

`aspire terminal ps` lists both resource-owned and AppHost-owned terminals. Its
backchannel response has required `resourceTerminals` and `appHostTerminals`
arrays, each empty when there are no terminals of that kind. Resource entries
group their replicas; AppHost entries carry a terminal ID, title, and placement.
The CLI's `--format json` output combines both into one array with an `owner`
discriminator. Terminal commands are gated by `features.terminalCommandsEnabled`;
their experimental backchannel contract can change between builds.

### Tape playback

`aspire terminal tape play <resource> --tape-file <path>` uses Hex1b's
`TapeParser` and `TapePlayer` to execute a VHS `.tape` script against an
existing resource terminal. It requires the same `features.terminalCommandsEnabled` feature
flag as `terminal attach` and `terminal ps`.

```sh
aspire terminal tape play shell --tape-file ./probe.tape
aspire terminal tape play shell --tape-file ./probe.tape --replica 1 --apphost ./AppHost/AppHost.csproj --timeout 30
```

For example, against an idle Bash shell:

```text
Set TypingSpeed 0
Set WaitTimeout 10s
Wait+Line /[$#>]$/
Type "printf 'ASPIRE_TAPE_%s\n' ready"
Enter
Wait+Screen /ASPIRE_TAPE_ready/
```

Wait for meaningful application output rather than merely the echoed input.
Here the expected marker is deliberately not contiguous in the typed command.
Exit code zero means the tape completed, not that every shell command succeeded.

The command prints the final plain-text screen to stdout; discovery messages,
warnings, and source-located diagnostics go to stderr. A comment-only or empty
tape reads the current screen after the initial producer snapshot has arrived.
A failed tape command prints its failure screen and returns a nonzero exit code.
`--timeout` defaults to 120 seconds and bounds waiting for the producer, the HMP
connection, and playback using cancellation. A producer that is temporarily absent
during startup or recycling can become available within that budget rather than
being immediately classified as exited. Capture finalization and cleanup may
continue after cancellation.
An overall timeout returns exit code 17, and user cancellation returns 130.

Playback connects as a secondary HMP peer. It does not request primary ownership,
resize the producer, create a new shell, or stop the resource on completion or
failure. Other viewers and input sources can remain attached; input is not
exclusive, so coordinate playback with other users. A disconnected transport
fails playback rather than retrying potentially non-idempotent input.

Supported commands follow the pinned Hex1b tape implementation: `Type`, keys and
chords, `Sleep`, `Wait` / `Wait+Line` / `Wait+Screen`, timing and wait settings,
`Source`, text `Output`, and `Hide` / `Show`. For example,
`Wait+Screen@5s /Ready/` sets that wait's timeout. This is not full VHS media or
presentation compatibility: screenshots/video, clipboard actions, scrolling,
font/pixel-size settings, and shell-launch/environment settings are rejected
during preflight before any input is sent.

`Source` and `.txt` / `.ascii` `Output` paths resolve relative to the root tape
file's directory on the **CLI machine**, including sources nested in other
directories. Output parent directories must already exist, and existing output
files are not overwritten. Included tapes must have the `.tape` extension;
their own `Output` directives are ignored. Text `Output` records per-command
screens, unlike stdout's final screen.

## DCP integration

For each replica of a `WithTerminal()` resource, DCP allocates a pseudo-terminal
when the executable (or container) spec carries a populated `terminal` block:

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "udsPath":    "/run/user/1000/aspire/trmnl/<run-id>/<resource>-<idx>/producer.sock",
    "socketMode": "connect",
    "cols":       132,
    "rows":       50
  }
}
```

`socketMode: "connect"` tells DCP to dial the named UDS (the TerminalHost
process owns the listener). The dimensions are the initial PTY size; both
sides exchange resize frames over HMP afterwards.

Desktop PTY support is implemented across all three platforms (Unix98 `/dev/ptmx` on Linux and macOS; ConPTY on Windows).
Container PTYs use the container runtime's attach command. DCP currently starts the
container before attaching, so one-time startup output, including terminal capability
queries, can be lost. See the [DCP startup ordering](https://github.com/microsoft/dcp/blob/v0.25.13/controllers/container_controller.go#L1843-L1855).

The `notcurses` resource in `playground/Terminals` installs Ubuntu's `notcurses-bin`
package and starts an interactive Bash shell. Open its dashboard Terminal view, then
run `notcurses-demo` to exercise graphics, color and Unicode rendering. Starting the
demo from the attached shell avoids losing its initial capability queries. Press
`q` to return to the shell; run the command again to repeat the stress workload.
