/**
 * `src/testing/e2eStateFileBridge.ts` is a test control channel: it registers a wildcard debug
 * adapter tracker, mirrors extension state to a file, and executes commands read from a file path
 * supplied in an environment variable. `extension.ts` imports it unconditionally, so without this
 * replacement the whole channel is bundled into the published extension and gated only by a runtime
 * environment variable - which anyone able to set environment variables on the VS Code process can
 * satisfy.
 *
 * Production is the mode `vscode:prepublish` builds in (`yarn package`), and therefore the mode
 * every shipped VSIX is built in, so swapping in a no-op module there keeps the bridge out of the
 * artifact entirely. The E2E workflow also packages through `vscode:prepublish`, so it must opt into
 * bundling the real bridge explicitly with `ASPIRE_EXTENSION_E2E_INCLUDE_BRIDGE=true`.
