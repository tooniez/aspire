 * Returns a cache entry holding the VS Code and ChromeDriver downloads for one key, populating a

 *
 * Entries are immutable and are never replaced in place. Each key owns a group directory whose
 * children are numbered generations (`entry-000001`, `entry-000002`, ...), and a generation is
 * published by renaming a fully populated candidate onto a name that does not exist yet. Readers
 * take the highest generation that validates, so a corrupt entry is stepped over by publishing the
 * next generation beside it instead of being deleted and replaced.
 *
 * That is what makes concurrency safe here without a lock: nothing this function deletes is
 * shared. A run only ever removes its own candidate, which has never been visible to anyone else,
 * or a group child that has been abandoned for hours. A run that observed a miss therefore cannot
 * destroy an entry another run published while it was downloading -- there is no canonical path
 * for it to overwrite, and the losing side of a publish adopts the winner.
 *
 * Two runs that cold-start at once still converge on a single entry. The generation a run
 * publishes to is derived from the same directory listing that failed to produce a usable entry,
 * so a run that cannot see an existing entry always aims at the generation that entry occupies and
 * collides with it rather than landing beside it. That costs a duplicate download when several
 * runs cold-start together, which is far cheaper than a lock protocol whose failure modes
 * (abandoned locks, half-released generations) can wedge every later run until a human deletes the

 *
 * Validating only the manifest paths would leave the rest of the projected tree unchecked, and

 * as long as they resolve inside the entry.
 *
 * Hard links are judged by reachability too, not by link count. `nlink` counts directory entries
 * filesystem-wide, and an archive can legitimately carry links that are entirely internal: tar
 * stores repeated content as a link entry (POSIX ustar type flag `1`, see
 * https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pax.html#tag_20_92_13_06) and GNU and
 * BSD tar both recreate it as a hard link on extraction. Two files inside one entry can therefore
 * share an inode with `nlink === 2` while nothing outside the cache can reach or mutate either,
 * so rejecting on `nlink > 1` alone would make every run against such an archive download, reject
 * and abort. Instead each multiply-linked inode is tallied across the walk and rejected only when
 * its links are not all accounted for inside the entry, because the unaccounted ones are exactly
 * the paths that could rewrite cached content from outside.
